# webpack-restaurant

In this project, I use a lot of the HTML/CSS/JS foundation that I've built thus far in my development journey, with the added bonus of using 
Webpack to package it all together. Dealing with configs and a more sprawled-out file structure was daunting at first, but
I am excited to use it more in the future now that I'm more familiar with it.
